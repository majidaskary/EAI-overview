# SYSTEM DESIGN  
## High-Level Design Principles for the Emotional Agent

This document describes the foundational system design ideas behind the project.

---

## 1. System Identity  
The system is an **Emotional Agent** combining:

- cognitive evaluation  
- emotional state dynamics  
- learning through feedback  
- LLM-based interaction  

Its identity emerges from the interaction of these components.

## 2. Processing Pipeline  

### **Step 1: Perception**  
The system receives and interprets user input through the LLM.

### **Step 2: Cognitive Appraisal**  
Assigns meaning, relevance, and expectation patterns.

### **Step 3: Emotion Update**  
Internal affective state shifts based on appraisal.

### **Step 4: Decision Shaping**  
Action tendencies are shaped by:
- emotional state  
- cognitive signals  
- RL-inspired adaptation  

### **Step 5: LLM Response**  
Response is generated and conditioned by the agent’s internal state.

### **Step 6: Reward Feedback**  
User input provides feedback which affects future tendencies.

### **Step 7: Memory Integration**  
Patterns reinforce long-term behavior.

- **Adaptive**  
- **Context-aware**  
- **Emotionally coherent**  
- **Explainable**  
- **Modular**  
- **Research-oriented**
