# CORE CONCEPTS  
Key theoretical domains involved in the Emotional Agent project.

---

## 1. Emotional Modeling  
- multi-dimensional affect representation  
- dynamic evolution (drift, decay)  
- cross-emotion modulation  
- mood emergence  

## 2. Cognitive Appraisal  
- abstract evaluation of meaning and relevance  
- expectation and prediction patterns  
- normative interpretation  

## 3. Reinforcement-Learning Inspiration  
- feedback-based adjustment  
- behavioral tendency shaping  
- reward-informed modulation  

## 4. LLM Integration  
LLMs act as:  
- interpreters of input  
- generators of emotionally-conditioned responses  
- expressive front-end for the agent’s internal state  

## 5. Memory & Profiling  
- short-term traces  
- long-term abstraction  
- user affect profiling  

These concepts form the theoretical backbone of the project.
