# Personal R&D Project:  
## Hybrid Emotional Agent with LLM Integration

This project is a research initiative focused on developing a **Hybrid Emotional Agent** — an agent that integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **cognitive–affective modeling**, and **reinforcement-learning–inspired adaptation**.  
The goal is to create a system that can understand user input, perform cognitive appraisal, update its internal emotional state, make decisions, learn from feedback, and generate responses that are cognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally aligned with its current state.

## Project Overview  

This project explores how modern intelligent systems can bring together multiple domains:

### • Emotional Agent Design  
Designing agents with internal affective variables, dynamic emotional states, mood drift/decay, and emotion-driven behavioral influence.

### • Cognitive Modeling  
High-level appraisal, expectation shaping, and reasoning structures that provide context-aware interpretation and internal evaluation.

### • Reinforcement-Learning Concepts  
Adaptive behavioral tendencies shaped by reward feedback, state transitions, emotional progress measures, and long-term adjustment.

### • Hybrid LLM Integration  
Using LLMs as the agent’s expressive and interpretive interface:  
- interpreting user input  
- generating emotionally conditioned responses  
- bridging cognitive and affective layers with natural language  
- enriching adaptive and context-aware communication  

### • Agent-Based Decision Flow  
Structuring behavior through a multi-stage cycle of perception, appraisal, emotional updating, drive/desire modulation, decision selection, and reflective learning.

## Core Technical Domains (High-Level)

### **1. Emotional Modeling**
- affective variables  
- cross-emotion influences  
- temporal drift & decay  
- dominant mood representation  
(Conceptual only; implementation remains private.)

### **2. Cognitive Processing**
- appraisal mechanisms  
- expectation and context modeling  
- internal state interpretation  
- cognitive modulation of decisions

### **3. Adaptive Decision Layer**
Inspired by reinforcement learning:  
- evolving behavioral tendencies  
- reward-informed adaptation  
- hybrid policy shaping (affect + cognition)

### **4. LLM Hybrid Layer**
LLMs enable:  
- rich interpretation  
- contextualized narrative responses  
- emotional tone alignment  
- multimodal expression of internal state

### **5. Memory & User Modeling**
High-level structures for:  
- short-term trace storage  
- long-term abstracted patterns  
- affect-based user profiling  
- reflective state updates

## Conceptual Agent Loop

User Input → Cognitive Appraisal → Emotional State Update → Drives & Desires Influence → Hybrid Action Selection (RL + Affect + Cognitive Signals) → LLM-Conditioned Response Generation → Reward & Feedback Integration → Memory & State Adaptation

A detailed conceptual description is provided in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Summary  
This repository serves as a **public-facing showcase** of a next-generation  
**Hybrid Emotional Agent with LLM Integration** — an agent capable of perceiving,  
evaluating, feeling, deciding, and adapting within a unified conceptual architecture.  
All descriptions are high-level and safe for publication while reflecting the  
technical depth and interdisciplinary nature of the project.
