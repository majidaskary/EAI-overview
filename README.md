# Project Name  
A Modular Cognitive–Emotional Agent Framework  
*A high-level, documentation-first blueprint for designing adaptive and human-centered agent systems.*

---

## Introduction  
This repository presents a **non-technical, conceptual framework** for building modular, cognitive–emotional agents.  
It acts as a **public blueprint** for research, design exploration, and long-term architectural planning.

The project intentionally avoids implementation details, algorithms, or proprietary ideas.  
Instead, it formalizes how such systems *could* be structured at a conceptual level.

---

## Key Characteristics  
- **Documentation-first**: The project is driven by clear structure and written design.  
- **Modular architecture**: Each conceptual layer is independent and extendable.  
- **Human-centered mindset**: Focused on interaction, adaptation, and clarity.  
- **Public & collaborative**: Built with openness and transparency in mind.  
- **Long-term expandable**: Structured to grow without becoming rigid.

## Architecture (High-Level)  
The conceptual system is composed of the following layers:

1. **Core Foundations** – Shared structures and fundamental logic.  
2. **Modules** – Extendable components representing optional capabilities.  
3. **Interaction Layer** – Communication styles and system-user interfaces.  
4. **AI/Agents Layer (Optional)** – Adaptive or agent-like patterns.  
5. **Data & Analytics Layer** – High-level storage and insights.  
6. **Testing Layer** – Behavioral or conceptual validation.

For a detailed explanation, see `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Project Structure  
The project’s directory structure is outlined in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.  
It reflects a clean, expandable, documentation-centered repository.
